## Code Explanation

### CalculateLinkedNumbers Function

This function is used to calculate linked numbers and settings based on the input value. It takes a `value` parameter and multiplies it by 1.5 to get the linked value. The calculated linked value is then returned.

### PlacePendingOrders Function

This function is responsible for placing pending orders at specific times. It first gets the current time and the local time. If the current time matches the pending time, it proceeds to place pending orders based on identified entry points. The entry point is calculated using the `CalculateLinkedNumbers` function with a value of 1.0. The stop loss and take profit values are also calculated using the `CalculateLinkedNumbers` function with values of 0.5 and 2.0 respectively. Finally, it places a pending buy order and a pending sell order using the calculated values.

### ExecutePendingOrders Function

This function is used to execute pending orders. It first checks if there are any pending orders by checking the total number of orders. If there are pending orders, it loops through each order starting from the latest one. It retrieves the ticket number of the order and checks if it is a pending order. If it is a pending order, it executes the order by sending a sell order with the same ticket number, open price, and other necessary parameters.

### OperateOn5MinuteTimeframe Function

This function operates on a 5-minute timeframe. It first checks if the current timeframe is 5-minute. If it is, it calls the `PlacePendingOrders` and `ExecutePendingOrders` functions to perform the necessary trading operations.

### OnTick Function

This is the entry point of the expert advisor. It is triggered on every tick. The `OperateOn5MinuteTimeframe` function is called to ensure that the expert advisor operates strictly on a 5-minute timeframe.
